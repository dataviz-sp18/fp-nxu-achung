Final project
=============

The purpose of the final project is to apply principles of visual design and technical skills rendering graphics in R to a topic of your own substantive interests. Student may work individually or in teams of up to three. Students should identify early in the term a research question or topic of substantive importance to themselves, then use the skills developed in this course to design and present a visualization which explains the results. The form of this deliverable can take any number of forms:

-   A research paper with a substantial visualization component
-   A web site with a substantial (static) visualization component
-   An interactive web page built using [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [`flexdashboard`](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/), etc.

Deadlines
---------

By the end of the fourth week (April 20), students should select a topic and [submit a proposal](https://goo.gl/forms/s5A6zgaMZdoNhXp63). Students will present their projects to the class on **May 29**. Projects must be fully complete and submitted for grading by **Sunday, June 3 at 11:59 pm**.

Assessment
----------

Your project will be assessed on the following criteria:[1]

-   Is it truthful?
-   Is it functional?
-   Is it beautiful?
-   Is it insightful?
-   Is it enlightening?

The final project is worth 30 points.

Final Deliverables
------------------

Submit final deliverables to your GitHub repo by **Sunday, June 3 at 11:59 pm**.

The final deliverables include:

-   **Visualization**: the final product of your project. This could be a Markdown/HTML/PDF file of your research paper, a link to a Shiny app or web page hosting your visualization, etc. If this is located outside of the GitHub repository, make sure to include a link in your `README.md` file.
-   **Paper**: a 4-6 page paper to supplement your visualization explaining your major design choices. Expected components are:
    -   **Introduction** - an explanation of the problem/research question and the motivation for solving it.
    -   **Methods** - a detailed explanation of the visualization techniques you employed to solve the problem/answer the question.
    -   **Results/discussion** - what has the audience learned from your work? How is the visualization truthful, functional, beautiful, insightful, and/or enlightening?
-   **Readme**: In the repository's `README.md`, include a brief project description and instructions for a user to execute your code on their own computer (e.g. what software/packages to install, instructions to obtain data if not included in repo). Aim for your project to be *reproducible*. If you work with a partner, include a description of which components each of you contributed to the project.
-   **Code**: an implementation of your source code. Make sure your code is well-documented and interpretable to outsiders.
