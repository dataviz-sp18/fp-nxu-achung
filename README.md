## Project Description
In this project, our goal is to study **what factors affect the level of individual income in China**. It is commonly believed that the socioeconomic backgrounds and characteristics of residential community have large impact on the income level of individual. To extent the existed findings, we proposed the research question on what factors impact personal income and how they impact. Our main data source is China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) in 2010 and 2014.
